The Cold War Context - in what way does the Cold War drive the plot of the film? How does the Soviet threat drive the technological innovation on display in the film?<br /> <br /> 2. Level of Technology - what does Cyber look like at this time (1983&commasepar; mind you)? How&commasepar; for instance&commasepar; does one get on-line? And what (if anything) does Cyber-Security involve?<br /> <br /> 3. Military-Industrial Complex - what role does the military play in the development of Cyber-Space? How does the military draw on different sectors of society (the University&commasepar; for instance) to achieve its objectives?<br /> <br /> 4. Automation and Artificial Intelligence - in the military\'s estimation&commasepar; how does WOPR represent an improvement over human agents? By the end of the film&commasepar; how has WOPR changed? Is it more or less like the humans it replaced?<br /> <br /> 5. Man vs. Machine - although this story has a very specific focus (Cold War&commasepar; Military Technology&commasepar; etc.)&commasepar; its theme is nevertheless timeless. How does it help us to see the problem man always has with the things he builds?

You have an attachment to your BOE-Bot that you will need to program in order to hit a marble golf ball around the course. There are two courses (Course A and Course B) with different objectives on each course. Starting position on each course is up to each team.</p>
<p><strong>Course A</strong></p>
<p>You will be given five minutes on this course during which time you will be challenged to score as many points as possible. There will be 12 marbles placed on the field in a predetermined pattern. The pattern will be marked on the field&commasepar; and will be the same for all teams.<br /> <br /> One point will be awarded for scoring a marble in the center hole<br /> Three points for the hole to the right of center<br /> Five points for the hole to the left of center</p>
<p>Note: the holes have differering levels of inclination.<br /> <br /><strong>Course B</strong></p>
<p>This field will only have five marbles placed in a set pattern. You will be given five minutes on this field to score as many points as possible using the same scoring system as the first field. Five bonus points will be awarded on this field for scoring with all of the marbles.<br /> <br /> Only the \"putter\" may be used to move the marble. You are not allowed to push the marble around with the bot itself. The initial starting point for both courses is left up to each team to decide. You can choose any location to begin the challenge.<br /> <br /> The&nbsp;putting greens&nbsp;will be available for practice in Bogard Hall 305 during Team Time.

It forces us to ask: \"Is there&commasepar; in all republics&commasepar; this inherent and fatal weakness? Must a Government&commasepar; of necessity&commasepar; be too strong for the liberties of its own people&commasepar; or too weak to maintain its own existence?\"<br /> <br /> Though Lincoln was clearly dealing here with problems specific to the Civil War&commasepar; the issues he raises are as relevant today as they were then. Is it possible for a government&commasepar; which has as its first duty the protection of life&commasepar; to also protect the rights and freedoms of its people? Does the government on occasion have to sacrifice freedom and liberty for security? If so&commasepar; what is to prevent it from abusing its power? Conversely&commasepar; are there any rights that the government must hold inviolable&commasepar; i.e.&commasepar; that under no circumstances may it infringe upon these rights? If so&commasepar; what are these rights&commasepar; and what makes them so important? Discuss these issues explicitly in the context of digital technology and Cyber-Security: what are the issues we face when using the Internet&commasepar; and how can we best address them?
