<p>Your essay should directly answer the question. It should refer to and cite specific evidence from the provided documents. Keep in mind the issues that we raised this morning regarding the use of sources. Approach your sources critically&commasepar; considering in particular the issue of reliability&commasepar; authorship&commasepar; and audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may use outside sources for reference purposes&commasepar; but keep in mind that each additional source must go through the same rigorous vetting process. Use whatever method of citation you find most effective. The only requirement is that you remain consistent throughout your essay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your essay must be limited to 500 words and is due at 8:30 am on Wednesday&commasepar; July 22.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DO NOT put any identifying information in your document or your file name. In other words&commasepar; an anonymous reviewer should not be able to identify you or your school based on the file you submit.&nbsp;</p>

If everything truly is a text and everything really does have an argument (whether it&rsquo;s to convince&commasepar; persuade&commasepar; inform&commasepar; explore&commasepar; make decisions)&commasepar; then you will be able to apply these skills to the following texts: the DHS Agent bios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your task is to look at the Agent bios and write a 500 word essay in which you describe what the &ldquo;argument&rdquo; and the &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; is in the bios. You may focus on one or two (or if you find there&rsquo;s an argument and analysis to be made in looking at all of them&commasepar; that&rsquo;s fine too). What you need to do is be specific about what the bios tell you about the agent(s)&mdash;what can you learn about them by analyzing the information in just the bio? You should also&commasepar; as part of your argument&commasepar; explain how you arrived at the argument&commasepar; i.e.&commasepar; what kind of research did you do&commasepar; what led you to investigate the information you chose to investigate&commasepar; why did you choose the bio(s) you choose?&nbsp;</p>

We believe one of the four individuals below was somehow involved in the illegal access of the cargo train&commasepar; in violation of 18 U.S.C.

Your first task is to select which individual you believe&commasepar; based on the evidence to date&commasepar; should be our most significant target of interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The individuals on our short list include:</p>
<p>Pete Bishop</p>
<p>Sandra Bullock</p>
<p>Raphael Sabmud</p>
<p>Donald Webre</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have determined which individual is the most likely suspect&commasepar; you need to initiate your investigation by writing a search warrant for his or her personal email correspondence. The warrant should include the facts establishing probable cause and identify what you expect to find which would substantiate that a crime has been committed.</p>(*)1437789600|!|e7da8e1e0000a982e7ac6d5a284bb2f7(*)Briefing Documentation(*)19f6eaa727685f6c13c84c8c6cf68df7(*)1437777230(*)(*)(*)<p>Each team should submit their Briefing Protocol by 8:50 in the morning.
