If everything truly is a text and everything really does have an argument (whether it&rsquo;s to convince&commasepar; persuade&commasepar; inform&commasepar; explore&commasepar; make decisions)&commasepar; then you will be able to apply these skills to the following texts: the DHS Agent bios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your task is to look at the Agent bios and write a 500 word essay in which you describe what the &ldquo;argument&rdquo; and the &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; is in the bios. You may focus on one or two (or if you find there&rsquo;s an argument and analysis to be made in looking at all of them&commasepar; that&rsquo;s fine too). What you need to do is be specific about what the bios tell you about the agent(s)&mdash;what can you learn about them by analyzing the information in just the bio? You should also&commasepar; as part of your argument&commasepar; explain how you arrived at the argument&commasepar; i.e.&commasepar; what kind of research did you do&commasepar; what led you to investigate the information you chose to investigate&commasepar; why did you choose the bio(s) you choose?&nbsp;</p>(*)1498051800|!|5dd0ec24d87818a07982d8d0aa569cd4(*)Essay 2(*)19f6eaa727685f6c13c84c8c6cf68df7(*)1498077824(*)(*)(*)<p>Read the article on <a href="camps/b6fe479a8151631e34277404e7d5d075/assignments_uploads/Cultural%20differences%20reading.pdf">cultural differences</a>.</p>
<p>Write a 500 word essay addressing the following questions:</p>
<p>How do you feel your culture affects your use of language? Discuss features such as your age&commasepar; ethnic background&commasepar; gender&commasepar; and cultural traditions. Considering the examples from the article&commasepar; draw upon how these are portrayed in your own communication; i.e.&commasepar; the gestures you use (eye contact&commasepar; personal space)&commasepar; the amount or lack of politeness in your interactions&commasepar; and what words mean based on your culture (punctuality&mdash;hour). Finally&commasepar; explain how miscommunications happen due to cultural differences. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your essay may be written from one group member&rsquo;s perspective or a collective overview. i.e. one of you may express how your gender as a male/female affects&nbsp; your use of language while another team member addresses how his/her ethnic background plays a role in communication. You may also include various perspectives reflected in your teams (analyzing different genders&commasepar; ethnic backgrounds&commasepar; traditions&commasepar; etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>(*)1498138200|!|44e31bc48054e046f929f42b226a8fa3(*)Essay 3(*)d259eb37bc4b04d541b63122d52e40e9(*)1498144201(*)d259eb37bc4b04d541b63122d52e40e9(*)1498144553(*)<p>Judging an Intelligence Report<br /><br />500 word&commasepar; typed essay.<br /><br />Consider <a href="camps/b6fe479a8151631e34277404e7d5d075/assignments_uploads/FBI%20File.pdf">this FBI intelligence report</a> from 1953.

<p>Your task is to look through the provided articles and analyze the climate of uncertainty surrounding the India-Pakistan dispute over the Kashmir region. You are also welcome to consult additional sources or news articles&commasepar; but don&rsquo;t rely too heavily on your memory of the first scenario&commasepar; as some narrative license was taken for the story.</p>
<p>Please write a 500-word essay that highlights two to three sources of uncertainty between India and Pakistan&commasepar; and how both sides might interpret/misperceive the actions of the other. Can these obstacles be overcome? If so&commasepar; what suggestions would you make to the leaders of India and Pakistan to resolve their conflict? &nbsp;</p>
