<p>The bot will start at the location marked by the green circle. The objective of this competition is for the bot to follow your program and arrive at the location marked by the red "no" symbol.

<p>Points will be awarded starting with 100 points to the team that completes the maze in the fastest time down to 10 points to the team that either finishes the maze in the slowest time or is the farthest from the objective when their bot stalls. Each team will receive&nbsp;two runs on the maze. Each team will run the maze once&commasepar; and then the queue will be repeated for the second run of the maze.

You have an attachment to your BOE-Bot that you will need to program in order to hit a marble golf ball around the course. There are two courses (Course A and Course B) with different objectives on each course. Starting position on each course is up to each team. You have to use the putter to move the marbles.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Course A (12 Marbles)</strong></p>
<p>You will be given five minutes on this course during which time you will be challenged to score as many points as possible. There will be 12 marbles placed on the field in a predetermined pattern. The pattern will be marked on the field&commasepar; and will be the same for all teams.&#8232;&#8232;</p>
<p>One point will be awarded for scoring a marble in the center hole&#8232;</p>
<p>Three points for the hole to the right of center&#8232;</p>
<p>Five points for the hole to the left of center</p>
<p>Note: the holes have differing levels of inclination.&#8232;&#8232;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Course B (5 Marbles)</strong></p>
<p>This field will only have five marbles placed in a set pattern. You will be given five minutes on this field to score as many points as possible using the same scoring system as the first field. Five bonus points will be awarded on this field for scoring with all of the marbles.&#8232;&#8232;</p>
<p>Only the "putter" may be used to move the marble. You are not allowed to push the marble around with the bot itself. The initial starting point for both courses is left up to each team to decide. You can choose any location to begin the challenge.&#8232;&#8232;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;putting greens&nbsp;will be available for practice during Team Time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Queue</strong></p>
<p>The queue will be determined using the results from Boe-Bot Challenge 1. In the order of the results&commasepar; teams will chose which field to start in and what the starting position will be (1 through 4). The four teams will start on their respective course&commasepar; and then move over to the other course competing in the same order.</p>

Or is he a better officer with the visor down&commasepar; when his programming takes over&commasepar; and when he has only the illusion of control?</p>
<p>In a letter of no more than 500 words&commasepar; I want you to write to Senator Dreyfus&commasepar; explaining how you think the United States should handle the future of the Robocop program. If you choose to agree with him&commasepar; I want you to explain why it is that Alex&rsquo;s control over his suit is more important for society than the greater level of protection he provides as a robot. And if you choose to disagree with Senator Dreyfus&commasepar; I want you to explain why the security of the country is more important than Alex&rsquo;s freedom from&commasepar; and hence control over&commasepar; his robot body.&nbsp;</p>
