<p><em>Why were Japanese Americans interned during World War II?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your essay should directly answer the question. It should refer to and cite specific evidence from the provided documents. Keep in mind the issues that we raised this morning regarding the use of sources. Approach your sources critically&commasepar; considering in particular the issue of reliability&commasepar; authorship&commasepar; and audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may use outside sources for reference purposes&commasepar; but keep in mind that each additional source must go through the same rigorous vetting process. Use whatever method of citation you find most effective. The only requirement is that you remain consistent throughout your essay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your essay must be limited to 500 words and is due at 8:15 am on Wednesday&commasepar; June 22.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DO NOT put any identifying information in your document or your file name. In other words&commasepar; an anonymous reviewer should not be able to identify you or your school based on the file you submit.&nbsp;</p>(*)1466601300|!|d330fffb39854ddd0fd55e782e856871(*)Essay 2(*)c65708364809cd385b24d3c5bcc8b403(*)1466626994(*)(*)(*)<p>What you will do for this writing assignment is apply what we talked about today regarding argument and analysis. If everything truly is a text and everything really does have an argument (whether it&rsquo;s to convince&commasepar; persuade&commasepar; inform&commasepar; explore&commasepar; make decisions)&commasepar; then you will be able to apply these skills to the following texts: the DHS Agent bios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your task is to look at the Agent bios and write a 500 word essay in which you describe what the &ldquo;argument&rdquo; and the &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; is in the bios. You may focus on one or two (or if you find there&rsquo;s an argument and analysis to be made in looking at all of them&commasepar; that&rsquo;s fine too). What you need to do is be specific about what the bios tell you about the agent(s)&mdash;what can you learn about them by analyzing the information in just the bio? You should also&commasepar; as part of your argument&commasepar; explain how you arrived at the argument&commasepar; i.e.&commasepar; what kind of research did you do&commasepar; what led you to investigate the information you chose to investigate&commasepar; why did you choose the bio(s) you choose?&nbsp;</p>

Each paragraph will have a very specific task&commasepar;<br />which are as follows:</p>
<p>In paragraph one&commasepar; choose a piece of data or information from today's<br />scenario that you felt you or your group could easily<br />dismiss/understand without much thought. Explain why this part of the<br />scenario seemed so easy to grasp&commasepar; ie&commasepar; why you did not have to think<br />much about "meaning" vis-&agrave;-vis this particular piece of information?<br />Why was this piece of information/data so "easy" to interpret? Think<br />about what I said today about general concepts and stereotypes.</p>
<p>In paragraph two&commasepar; explain how the same piece of data/information from<br />your first paragraph could possibly be interpreted in a completely<br />different manner. How did a little extra thought change the meaning<br />of the data/information? Did context or some other specific piece of<br />information help? What exception did you find from the<br />generalization/stereotype in paragraph one? Do not feel as if you<br />must answer each of these questions but use them to brainstorm.</p>
<p>In your final paragraph&commasepar; using your previous two examples for support&commasepar;<br />come to a conclusion about perception and interpretation.</p>(*)1466774100|!|2a20a0887d290f21a1a36b2ac6ea6cdc(*)Warrant Assignment(*)c65708364809cd385b24d3c5bcc8b403(*)1466805175(*)(*)(*)<p><span>AGENTS:</span><br /><br /><span>BEFORE YOU CAN COMPLETE THIS ASSIGNMENT&commasepar; YOU MUST MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL</span><br /><span>DECISION.
