The Cold War Context - in what way does the Cold War drive the plot of the film? How does the Soviet threat drive the technological innovation on display in the film?<br /> <br /> 2. Level of Technology - what does Cyber look like at this time (1983&commasepar; mind you)? How&commasepar; for instance&commasepar; does one get on-line? And what (if anything) does Cyber-Security involve?<br /> <br /> 3. Military-Industrial Complex - what role does the military play in the development of Cyber-Space? How does the military draw on different sectors of society (the University&commasepar; for instance) to achieve its objectives?<br /> <br /> 4. Automation and Artificial Intelligence - in the military\'s estimation&commasepar; how does WOPR represent an improvement over human agents? By the end of the film&commasepar; how has WOPR changed? Is it more or less like the humans it replaced?<br /> <br /> 5. Man vs. Machine - although this story has a very specific focus (Cold War&commasepar; Military Technology&commasepar; etc.)&commasepar; its theme is nevertheless timeless. How does it help us to see the problem man always has with the things he builds? Does technological innovation always equal progress?</p>

The computer in the room off of Cosmo\'s office in the PlayTronics building (the one that looks like a circular bench) is actually a Cray Y-MP&commasepar; a multi-million dollar supercomputer that was one of the world\'s fastest computers at the time the film was made. James Earl Jones\' character&commasepar; Bernard Abbott&commasepar; was named after Robert Abbott&commasepar; a charismatic technical consultant for the film. Abbott designed the first time-sharing (multi-user) operating system for the Cray CDC-6600&commasepar; the predecessor of the Y-MP seen in the film. He is also often referred to as the \"Father of Information Security\" by seasoned veterans of the computing industry.<br /><br />Questions for discussion: What&rsquo;s the purpose of the opening sequence in 1969?<br /><br />What is the role of the NSA (National Security Agency) as explained early in the film?<br /><br />What&rsquo;s the significance of the Scrabble game in the film?<br /><br />What&commasepar; exactly&commasepar; is Dr. Janek&rsquo;s &ldquo;black box&rdquo;?<br /><br />What is Cosmo&rsquo;s plan for &ldquo;changing the world&rdquo; and why does he need the &ldquo;black box&rdquo;?<br /><br />Do you agree with Cosmo&rsquo;s argument at the end of the film that &ldquo;who controls the information&rdquo; will determine the balance of power in the future?

You have an attachment to your BOE-Bot that you will need to program in order to hit a marble golf ball around the course. There are two rounds associated with this challenge. For the first round&commasepar; you will be given five minutes on the green during which time you will be challenged to score as many points as possible. There will be 12 marbles placed on the field in a predetermined pattern. The pattern will be marked on the field&commasepar; and will be the same for all teams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After each team finishes the first challenge&commasepar; we will transition into the second challenge where the field will have&nbsp;only&nbsp;five marbles placed in a set pattern. You will be given five minutes on this field to score as many points as possible using the same scoring system as the first field. <em>Five bonus points will be awarded on this challenge for scoring with all 5 of the marbles.&nbsp; However&commasepar; for added incentive&commasepar; an additional 5 bonus points will be awarded for scoring with all 5 of the marbles in the same hole.</em></p>
<p><strong>One point will be awarded for scoring a marble in the center hole</strong></p>
<p><strong>Three points for the elevated&nbsp;larger&nbsp;hole&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Five points for the &nbsp;elevated&nbsp;smaller&nbsp;hole</strong></p>
<p><br /><br />Only the \"putter\" may be used to move the marble. You are not allowed to push the marble around with the bot itself. The initial starting point for both courses is left up to each team to decide. You can choose any location to begin the challenge.<br /><br />The&nbsp;<a title=\"Putting Greens\" href=\"camps/011a83e2144f78ec06c080b2ae7d00cb/assignments_uploads/GolfArena.docx\" target=\"_blank\">putting greens</a>&nbsp;will be available for practice in Bogomolny Room during afternoon Team Time.

<p><br />There will be 5 marbles placed on the field in a predetermined pattern. The pattern will be marked on the field&commasepar; and will be the same for all rounds. Each team will start their BOE-Bot in a corner on their side of the field. After the start of the competition&commasepar; you can position your bot anywhere on the field. Once a score is made&commasepar; the marble will be placed back on the field by a referee.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To obtain an order from the secret surveillance court&commasepar; authorities like the FBI must demonstrate that their requests comply with the legal requirements set out in the Surveillance Act.&nbsp; Confirming that the secret court has properly done its job is difficult&commasepar; however&commasepar; because all of the court&rsquo;s orders are treated as Top Secret information.&nbsp; Only people with the proper security clearance can read those orders.&nbsp; Indeed&commasepar; the Verizon order described above was only disclosed because it was leaked to the press&commasepar; and the informant who provided that information to the press is likely to face criminal espionage charges if he is apprehended by U.S. authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretend that the United States Congress is considering amending the Surveillance Act to require that surveillance orders be made public.&nbsp; In other words&commasepar; Congress is considering making the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court into a public court.&nbsp; Your task tonight is (i) to identify the benefits to privacy and the costs to security from such a policy&commasepar; (ii) to weigh these competing interests&commasepar; and (iii) to make a recommendation on whether the policy should be adopted.&nbsp; Your arguments should be well reasoned&commasepar; should consider the information provided in this Assignment&commasepar; any additional evidence you find in your own research&commasepar; and the ideas that you have considered throughout the week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essays will be judged on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the paper consider both the positive and the negative effects of disclosing surveillance orders?</li>
<li>Does the paper use credible evidence to support its points?</li>
<li>Does the paper use concepts that have been considered in previous humanities sessions to support its arguments?</li>
<li>Is the paper well written? Does it demonstrate care and thought?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your paper shouldn\'t exceed<strong> 500 words</strong>.</p>

<p>Hungry during London rush hour? Summon a drone to deliver a pizza from Domino&rsquo;s.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a></p>
<p>Curious about the number of Sandhill cranes nesting in Nebraska but don&rsquo;t want to get your feet wet? Send a drone over their wetland habitat.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a></p>
<p>Facing a burning building where victims may be trapped inside? Deploy a drone to survey the rooms before you send in a human rescue team. <a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]</a></p>
<p>Domestic entities of all sorts are finding innovative uses for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Until 2015&commasepar; Americans can legally manufacture&commasepar; buy and operate drones as long as they don&rsquo;t fly them commercially or near an airport. The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International estimates that by 2018&commasepar; the domestic drone industry could generate 70&commasepar;000 new jobs.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]</a></p>
<p>However&commasepar; drones also pose questions about privacy for American citizens.&nbsp; If drones can fly anywhere except for airspace around airports&commasepar; can they fly above your backyard and take pictures of you jumping on your trampoline? Can they hover outside your window? If you leave your window open&commasepar; can they fly inside? Could law enforcement use any pictures they took as evidence against you?&nbsp; If drones can stay aloft for 24 hours and can collect and store data indefinitely&commasepar; what happens to that data? Could it be connected to the speed cameras&commasepar; E-Z Pass information&commasepar; and cell phone tower records to build a case against you? Should there be limits placed on who can use it and under what circumstances?</p>
<p><strong>Should security concerns trump privacy concerns as America crafts domestic drone regulations?</strong></p>
<p>Your task tonight is to write a 500-word essay that answers the question above after weighing each side of the domestic drone issue. You may use the information in the links included on this page&commasepar; any additional evidence you find in your own research&commasepar; the expertise of your teachers and camp staff and the ideas that you have considered throughout the week. Essays will be judged on the following criteria:</p>
<p>Does the paper consider both the positive and the negative effects of domestic drone use?<br />Does the paper use credible evidence from a variety of sources to support its points?<br />Does the paper use concepts that have been considered in previous humanities sessions to support its arguments?<br />Is the paper well written? Does it demonstrate care and thought?</p>
