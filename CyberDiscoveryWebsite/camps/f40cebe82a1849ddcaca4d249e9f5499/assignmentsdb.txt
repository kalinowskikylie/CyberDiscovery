<p><span style="font-family: impact&commasepar; chicago; font-size: large; color: #0291d1;">Bot Challenge: Maze Running!</span></p>
<p>This BOE-Bot challenge requires your team to program one of your Bots to navigate a maze. Your Bot will not be tethered to a computer during this competition&commasepar; which means you cannot make mid-course corrections. You will need to write a program for the Bot&commasepar; giving it all the instructions it needs to complete the maze on its own.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7j0h8h0t08xhxm7/mazeDimensions.tiff?dl=0" target="_blank">A dimensioned figure of the maze is can be downloaded here.</a> You will be able to view the maze during Team Time on Tuesday afternoon&commasepar; and if you want to photograph it&commasepar; that's legal. However&commasepar; you will not be allowed to run your Bot through the maze until Wednesday morning. The maze will be available between 7:30AM and 8:45AM in MCST 103 on Wednesday morning&commasepar; and you may perform trial runs at that time.</p>
<p>Your Bot will begin at the location marked by the green square. You may place the Bot anywhere on the square&commasepar; but both wheels and the ball must be in the green. As your Bot follows the program you have written&commasepar; it should arrive at and stop on the location marked by the red square.</p>
<p>A timer will start when your Bot begins to move and will stop when your Bot arrives at the red square&commasepar; or becomes immobilized. While the entire Bot must begin in the green&commasepar; any part of the Bot may be touching the red square at the end. You have successfully completed the course even if only one wheel or the ball is in the red&commasepar; but "touching the red square" means <em>literally</em> touching. If your Bot is casting a shadow on the red...well&commasepar; that's not touching. You're close&commasepar; but...</p>
<p>You have a second chance. Each team will run the maze&commasepar; in the order determined by the queue. The results of Round 1 will be recorded&commasepar; and then each team gets another shot. After two rounds&commasepar; only your best maze run will be counted for scoring purposes. If you have completed the maze twice&commasepar; your faster time will count. If you have not completed the course&commasepar; your stalled position closest to the red square will count.</p>
<p>Points will be awarded from 100 points to the team that completes the maze in the fastest time down to 30 points for the team that either finishes the maze with the slowest time or is the farthest from the objective when their Bot stalls. Ties will be broken in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>If two Bots are tied with identical primary completion times&commasepar; the secondary times will be compared. The team with the fastest combined time for both rounds wins the tie. This almost never happens.</li>
<li>It's possible for two Bots to be tied with identical primary completion times&commasepar; but only one Bot has completed the maze twice (the other Bot stalled). The team with two complete maze runs wins the tie. This almost never happens either.</li>
<li>Also possible: two Bots are be tied with identical primary completion times&commasepar; but neither Bot has completed the maze twice. The team with the secondary stall closest to the red square wins the tie. Seriously&commasepar; ties are exceedingly unusual.</li>
<li>Bots which do not complete the maze on either trial will be ranked by their best trial. If your bot gets closer to the red square&commasepar; you rank higher. "Closer" will be measured along the path of the maze you programmed and intended to travel. If it is not obvious which bot has gotten closer&commasepar; a line judge will measure your bot's intended path from the stall to the center of the red square.</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not have to submit anything for this assignment via the blog. Please be ready to run the maze at the beginning of the Boe-Bot session on Wednesday morning.</p>(*)1434550500|!|f63199d2e322fefcccd446e544a38599(*)Assignment 04: Essay 01(*)c08c41e786c33f4f13352d052764d8a0(*)1434471894(*)d259eb37bc4b04d541b63122d52e40e9(*)1434549048(*)<!--Activity 04: Writing Assignment 01-->

<p><span style="font-family: impact&commasepar; chicago; font-size: large; color: #0291d1;">Bot Challenge: Putt-Putt Golf</span></p>
<p>This next BOE-Bot challenge: mini-golf! You have a putter attachment for your BOE-Bot&commasepar; which you will program to hit a marble golf ball around a putting green. There are two greens: Augusta (Course A) and Barnbougle (Course B). Your starting position on each course is up to your team&commasepar; and your objectives are different for each green. Once you begin&commasepar; you must move the marbles only with your putter; you may not bulldoze the marbles with your Bot. You will navigate your Bot using keyboard commands&commasepar; so you remain tethered to your laptop&commasepar; but you will have access to a long USB cable which will give the Bot free range over the entire course.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: impact&commasepar; chicago; font-size: large; color: #faa634;">Course Augusta: Five Minutes&commasepar; 12 Marbles</span><br /> You will be given five minutes on this course&commasepar; during which time you will be challenged to score as many points as possible. Twelve marbles will be placed on the field using the specific positions marked. There are fifteen start positions&commasepar; and each team may select which three positions they do not want for their marbles. The holes have differing levels of difficulty due to inclination&commasepar; so scoring will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>One point will be awarded for scoring a marble in the shallowest/widest hole in the center.</li>
<li>Three points for the smaller&commasepar; sloped hole to the left.</li>
<li>Five points for the steepest smallest hole on the right.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: impact&commasepar; chicago; font-size: large; color: #faa634;">Course Barnbougle: Five Minutes&commasepar; 5 Marbles</span><br /> This green also has three holes with differing degrees of difficulty. You will have only five marbles to place (choosing from seven starting positions)&commasepar; and you will be given only five minutes to score as many points as possible. The scoring system is the same as the first course&commasepar; with a potential five point bonus. Any team that clears the green (scores with all five marbles&commasepar; in any hole) will be awarded a five point bonus.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: impact&commasepar; chicago; font-size: large; color: #faa634;">Practice</span><br /> Both putting greens will be available for practice during Wednesday afternoon Team Time. You should be able to access the greens Thursday morning (from 7:30-8:45)&commasepar; but you should not rely on this as your only practice. Please respect this time limitation&commasepar; and allow other teams equal access. Also&commasepar; please repect the greens themselves and keep all food and drink well away from the felt.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: impact&commasepar; chicago; font-size: large; color: #faa634;">Competition</span><br /> The Golf Challenge will begin Thursday morning at 9:15. The queue will be determined using the results from the Maze Challenge. In the order of the results&commasepar; teams will chose a course to start on (A or B) and a starting position (1 through 4). The four teams will start on their chosen course&commasepar; then switch to the other course to compete in the same order.</p>
<p>Each team will have one round on each course&commasepar; and there are no re-starts or do-overs. If your Bot becomes immobilized or tips over&commasepar; you may have one Mulligan. If you call for a Mulligan&commasepar; a line judge will re-position your Bot on the field and you will continue play. <em>You may only do this one time&commasepar; on one course.</em> If your Bot trips up again&commasepar; you may not assist it in any way (although sometimes you can use the putter to put yourself right). NOTE: No submission via the blog is necessary for this assignment.</p>(*)1434636900|!|4b6a386f4f8ca0f829d3db6e51b7d776(*)Assignment 09: Reading 03(*)c08c41e786c33f4f13352d052764d8a0(*)1434563659(*)(*)(*)<!--Activity 09: Nicholas Carr Reading Assignment-->

<p>A match will consist of four minutes on the field&commasepar; during which time you will be challenged to cooperate with you partner school to score as many goals as possible. There will be a total of 4 bots on the field at a time&commasepar; two from each team.</p>
<p>You will be able to use any attachment that you purchase at Thursday night's auction&commasepar; so you should program your Bot accordingly. In addition&commasepar; you will be navigating wirelessly. This means that you will keep one of your Bots tethered to the computer&commasepar; while your other ranges freely on the field.</p>
<p>To begin play&commasepar; 5 marbles will be placed on the field in a predetermined pattern. The pattern will be clearly marked on the field&commasepar; and will be the same for all teams. Each team will initially position their Bot in a corner on their side of the field. After the start of the competition&commasepar; you can maneuver your bot anywhere on the field (no offside penalties!). Once a goal is scored&commasepar; that marble will be returned to play when a referee places it back onto one of the designated spots. Each game will last 4 minutes.</p>
<p>If your bot is immobilized or you feel it is about to be immobilized you are allowed to request assistance. If assistance is requested&commasepar; your bot will be removed from the field for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds&commasepar; your bot will be returned to your team's starting corner.</p>
<p>One point will be awarded for scoring a marble in the opposing team's goal&commasepar; and the team which scores the most goals wins the match. Your individual school will receive 4 points for a win&commasepar; 2 points for a tie&commasepar; and zero points for a loss. At the end of the tournament&commasepar; your school's score will be the sum of your individual win/tie points. The school with the highest overall score will receive 100 points&commasepar; the next highest score will receive 90 points&commasepar; etc.</p>
<p>In the event of a tie&commasepar; the goal differential will be used to determine placement. As an example&commasepar; let's assume two teams are tied with scores of 8 (two wins&commasepar; two losses). Team 1 outscored their opponents by 5 goals (adding up all four matches)&commasepar; but Team 2 outscored their opponents by 8 goals. In this case&commasepar; Team 2 wins the tie because they won their games by larger margins.</p>
<p>What happens if two teams have identical scores and identical goal differentials? Rock/paper/scissors.</p>
<p>The soccer field will be available for practice in MCST 103 during Thursday afternoon Team Time. It will also be open for practice Friday morning between 7:30-8:45AM&commasepar; before Movie Discussion time.</p>(*)1434738600|!|5a9a40b39375f620843e893b2ec6afa9(*)Assignment 13: Reading 04(*)c08c41e786c33f4f13352d052764d8a0(*)1434646301(*)(*)(*)<!--Activity 14: Christian Davenport Reading Assignment-->

<p>The digital film assignment asks each team to present a creative treatment that provides a storyline for the final BOE-bot competition. As you know&commasepar; the final competition will involve BOE-bots collecting marbles in an arena that looks like a mesh between Tech's campus&commasepar; the UCA campus&commasepar; and robotics/cryptography elements.</p>
<p>Each team will have ten minutes (3-5 minute presentation with 7-10 minutes for questions) for the presentation of their digital film. The presentations will take place on Saturday morning before the BOE-bot competition. The presentations will be held in LSC 100 (same rooms as the movies).</p>
<p>An evaluation rubric will be posted as soon as available.</p>(*)1434801600|!|2db9959066ffb4cbef8e14e491cd65da(*)Assignment 15: Movie 04 Discussion(*)c08c41e786c33f4f13352d052764d8a0(*)1434671996(*)(*)(*)<!--Activity 15: Movie 04 (War Games) Discussion Questions-->

<p>The final BOE-Bot Battle for Cyber Supremacy will take place Saturday morning at 10:00AM in the Student Center Ballroom. Once you have completed your storyline film presentation and eaten all the donuts you can hold&commasepar; head straight over to the Student Center to get set up and situated.</p>
<p>Let's review a few gentle suggestions and one or two hard and fast rules:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: impact&commasepar; chicago; font-size: large; color: #faa634;">Format</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Six-Minute Rounds:</strong> There are six independent rounds&commasepar; and each round lasts six minutes. Your bot must begin each round positioned with all three wheels on your fort (which has been properly placed on your battle station). Once the clock has started&commasepar; there are no restarts or do-overs&commasepar; and you are free to move about the arena. <em>When the round timer expires&commasepar; all bots stop&commasepar; <strong>no exceptions</strong>.</em></li>
<li><strong>Collecting Marbles</strong>: During the round&commasepar; your goal is to navigate the arena&commasepar; collect as many marbles as you can&commasepar; and return them to the safety of your fort.</li>
<li><strong>Four-Minute Breaks:</strong> At the end of each round&commasepar; there is a 4-minute break in which your marbles are collected&commasepar; counted&commasepar; and recorded. While this is happening&commasepar; you will be moving your bot and fort to the next battle station&commasepar; moving the the next station on your left (clockwise around the arena).</li>
<li><strong>Redistributing Marbles:</strong> After each round's marbles have been collected and counted&commasepar; all marbles are returned to the center of the arena. The distribution of the marbles will be as random as possible&commasepar; but please recall that they are <em>spheres</em>&commasepar; and spheres will <em>roll</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Counting Marbles:</strong> Each marble in your fort when the round ends will be counted. Marbles confined by your jaw when the clock runs out do not count; marbles sitting on the ramp or deck of your fort do not count; marbles on the battlefield kind of close to your fort do not count. <em>Only the marbles which have been safely deposited according to the design of your fort will be counted</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Scoring Rounds:</strong> This is where it gets a bit tricky! Each round is an independent skirmish. At the end of each round&commasepar; teams will be ranked by the number of marbles collected only during that specific round. The team with the most marbles for the round earns 100 points&commasepar; second = 90 points&commasepar; etc.. Your rank in Round 01 does not carry over into Round 02&commasepar; and your marble count is not cumulative. The team that collects the most marbles in Round 02 gets 100 points&commasepar; regardless of how many marbles they may or may not have deposited in Round 01.</li>
<li><strong>Determining the Winner:</strong> So&commasepar; in each of the six rounds there will be 520 points distributed. The same team almost certainly won't win every round&commasepar; but one team could finish with the maximum 600 points (the minimum possible = 180 points) when all the rounds are added up. The winning team will have the highest point total&commasepar; which is not necessarily the highest marble count!</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: impact&commasepar; chicago; font-size: large; color: #0291d1;">Strategy</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emergency Repairs:</strong> There will be a Repair Station manned by at least one qualified Bot Tech. If your bot becomes immobilized due to an <em>emergency</em> technical issue&commasepar; you may have your line judge remove your bot from the field and deliver it to the Repair Station. We will diagnose and repair or replace as quickly as we can. <strong>If your bot is removed due to emergency&commasepar; you are out for the round.</strong> This is <em>not</em> Roadside Assistance where you are placed upright back on the field to continue collecting marbles. Upside down and crying because you got flipped is not an emergency&commasepar; and overflowing your buffer is best dealt with by restarting the program as quickly as you can.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Emergency Service:</strong> You may take your bot to the Repair Station between rounds for non-emergency servicing. Typically&commasepar; this hasn't been needed--those bots are pretty robust. But you might need fresh batteries. If you need bolts tightened&commasepar; it's probably quicker to pull out your screwdriver and do it yourself between rounds.</li>
<li><strong>Mutually Assured Destruction:</strong> While you certainly have the capability to flip your opponents' bots and demolish your opponents' forts&commasepar; you need to consider whether that strategy is viable and/or sustainable. You might be feeling pretty smug after you wreak havoc in Round 01&commasepar; but you better be prepared to reap the whirlwind in the next round&commasepar; when what goes around comes around!</li>
<li><strong>Mutual Adoration Societies:</strong> You might be friends with another team. That's cool. If you have any informal agreements like "Don't flip us&commasepar; we won't flip you&commasepar;" that's cool&commasepar; too. However&commasepar; if it turns into a trade or financial transaction&commasepar; it must be brokered through The Banker (Dr. Turner).</li>

<p><span style="font-family: impact&commasepar; chicago; font-size: large; color: #faa634;">Writing Assignment for Christian Davenport&commasepar; &ldquo;Military Push for Emergency Robot Worries Skeptics About Lethal Uses&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>In his Washington Post article (May 17&commasepar; 2015)&commasepar; Christian Davenport describes the Pentagon&rsquo;s (U.S. Department of Defense&rsquo;s) recent international robot competition held in Pomona&commasepar; California involving some 25 teams from around the world&commasepar; including teams from Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon University. Although the Pentagon claims that they are primarily interested in developing robots that can perform various humanitarian tasks&commasepar; Christian Davenport refers to concerns expressed about weapons technology (or Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems)&commasepar; including concerns expressed by representatives of the United Nations (UN) and human rights non-governmental organizations (NGOs).</p>
<p>For this writing assignment&commasepar; please imagine that your Cyber Discovery team has been formally invited to participate in the Pentagon&rsquo;s international robot competition. Please develop an approximately 500-word response to the invitation&commasepar; explaining or justifying your group&rsquo;s decision to participate or not participate. In your response&commasepar; please discuss some of the reasons for your group&rsquo;s participation&commasepar; or concerns that your group has about the competition.</p>
<p>You must submit your essay no later than 7:45AM on Saturday&commasepar; 06/20/15. Please be sure to use the online submission form.
