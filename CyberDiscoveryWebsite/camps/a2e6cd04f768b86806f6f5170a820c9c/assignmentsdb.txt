<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your essay should directly answer the question. It should refer to and cite specific evidence from the provided documents. Keep in mind the issues that we raised this morning regarding the use of sources. Approach your sources critically&commasepar; considering in particular the issue of reliability&commasepar; authorship&commasepar; and audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may use outside sources for reference purposes&commasepar; but keep in mind that each additional source must go through the same rigorous vetting process. Use whatever method of citation you find most effective. The only requirement is that you remain consistent throughout your essay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your essay must be limited to 500 words and is due at 8:15 am on Wednesday&commasepar; July 23.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DO NOT put any identifying information in your document or your file name. In other words&commasepar; an anonymous reviewer should not be able to identify you or your school based on the file you submit.&nbsp;</p>

If everything truly is a text and everything really does have an argument (whether it&rsquo;s to convince&commasepar; persuade&commasepar; inform&commasepar; explore&commasepar; make decisions)&commasepar; then you will be able to apply these skills to the following texts: the DHS Agent bios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your task is to look at the Agent bios and write a 500 word essay in which you describe what the &ldquo;argument&rdquo; and the &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; is in the bios. You may focus on one or two (or if you find there&rsquo;s an argument and analysis to be made in looking at all of them&commasepar; that&rsquo;s fine too). What you need to do is be specific about what the bios tell you about the agent(s)&mdash;what can you learn about them by analyzing the information in just the bio? You should also&commasepar; as part of your argument&commasepar; explain how you arrived at the argument&commasepar; i.e.&commasepar; what kind of research did you do&commasepar; what led you to investigate the information you chose to investigate&commasepar; why did you choose the bio(s) you choose?&nbsp;</p>

We believe one of the four companies below was involved in the illegal access of the pertinent drone&commasepar; in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1030(a)1 (accessing a computer and obtaining national security information). Your first task is to select which company you believe&commasepar; based on the evidence to date&commasepar; should be our most significant target of interest.</p>
<p>The companies on our short list include:</p>
<ul>
<li>KIT APL</li>
<li>Drone Inc.</li>
<li>Ocsic</li>
<li>Soleus</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have determined which company is the most likely suspect&commasepar; you need to initiate your investigation by writing a search warrant for the email traffic to and from this company. The warrant should include the facts establishing probable cause and identify what you expect to find which would substantiate that a crime has been committed.</p>
<p>You should conform (as much as is possible) with the guidelines provided to you during the session concerning the proper way to write a search warrant&commasepar; in approximately 500 words.&nbsp;</p>(*)1406336400|!|8b6941554a5fe3fa1cb8fc46e2c64eb3(*)Final Briefing Powerpoint(*)19f6eaa727685f6c13c84c8c6cf68df7(*)1406327650(*)19f6eaa727685f6c13c84c8c6cf68df7(*)1406331193(*)<p>For your final briefing on Saturday to the agents at DHS&commasepar; you are allowed to use a 5 slide powerpoint to assist your team in presenting. It is not a requirement to use this electronic presentation aid&commasepar; but it is available. The middle screen in the briefing room (University Hall) will show the information that you provide. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>University Hall will be open at 8:00 for you to begin turning in your powerpoint presentations and prepare for your briefing. (your briefing form with 5 most significant documents are due at 9:00am in Bogard Hall 304)</li>
<li>You can choose to have Agent Tims advance your slides or a wireless presenter remote will be available for a member of the team</li>
<li>Animations that require "clicking" will not be allowed. If you use animations&commasepar; they must be timed as part of the slide. (Remember that the judges will not see these animations in the printed slides.)</li>
<li>You are only allowed 5 slides total</li>
<li>All slides due by 8:30am on the camp portal or to Agent Tims via USB thumb drive</li>
</ul>
<p>You can upload your slides through the activities upload as long as the file size is small enough. You can check to make sure your files were uploaded correctly by clicking on the submissions tab and searching for this assignment. If your file does not show&commasepar; then you may have to provide the file to Agent Tims on a thumb drive prior to the 8:30AM deadline! It is critical to have these before this deadline so that the slides can be printed for the judges.</p>(*)1406381400|!|
