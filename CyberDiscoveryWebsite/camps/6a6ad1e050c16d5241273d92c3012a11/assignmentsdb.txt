<p>1. The Cold War Context - in what way does the Cold War drive the plot of the film? How does the Soviet threat drive the technological innovation on display in the film?</p>
<p>2. Level of Technology - what does Cyber look like at this time (1983&commasepar; mind you)? How&commasepar; for instance&commasepar; does one get on-line? And what (if anything) does Cyber-Security involve?</p>
<p>3. Military-Industrial Complex - what role does the military play in the development of Cyber-Space? How does the military draw on different sectors of society (the University&commasepar; for instance) to achieve its objectives?</p>
<p>4. Automation and Artificial Intelligence - in the military's estimation&commasepar; how does WOPR represent an improvement over human agents? By the end of the film&commasepar; how has WOPR changed? Is it more or less like the humans it replaced?</p>
<p>5. Man vs. Machine - although this story has a very specific focus (Cold War&commasepar; Military Technology&commasepar; etc.)&commasepar; its theme is nevertheless timeless. How does it help us to see the problem man always has with the things he builds? Does technological innovation always equal progress?</p>(*)1465308000|!|ebf2544aae8335a95f1416c72f5178d3(*)BOE-Bot Challenge 1(*)c65708364809cd385b24d3c5bcc8b403(*)1465314527(*)c65708364809cd385b24d3c5bcc8b403(*)1465314574(*)<p>The first BOE-Bot challenge requires your team to program one of your bots to navigate a&nbsp;"Maze". Your bot will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;be tethered to your computer during this competition; therefore&commasepar; you will need to pre-program your bot to complete the maze on its own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bot will start at the location marked by the green circle. The objective of this competition is for the bot to follow your program and arrive at the location marked by the red "no" symbol. A timer will start when your bot begins to move and will stop when part of your bot arrives at the area marked with the red "no" symbol&nbsp;(or becomes immobilized).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Points will be awarded starting with 100 points to the team that completes the maze in the fastest time down to 10 points to the team that either finishes the maze in the slowest time or is the farthest from the objective when their bot stalls. Each team will receive&nbsp;two runs on the maze. Each team will run the maze once&commasepar; and then the queue will be repeated for the second run of the maze. The best run out of the two will be counted for the teams' final score.</p>
<p>NOTE: You do not have to submit anything for this assignment via the blog. Just be ready to run the maze at the beginning&nbsp;of the Boe-Bot session on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Both the Wendell Berry text and the Nicholas Carr essay deal with literacy and the connections we make with other humans and with information through the use (or lack thereof) of technology. Both readings make compelling arguments about the damage technology can have on those types of relationships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While technology might be changing the way we interact with people and while it might be changing how we read texts or take in information&commasepar; is this necessarily as bad as Carr suggests? Are we really becoming &ldquo;stupid&commasepar;&rdquo; or are we just &ldquo;processing differently&commasepar;&rdquo; so to speak?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your essay will respond to Carr&rsquo;s argument. What I want you to argue/offer is the counterpoint. In an essay of&nbsp;<strong>500 words</strong>&commasepar; argue why Google is&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>making us more stupid but rather why Google and the Internet could actually be making us smarter. You can choose to respond to Carr however you&rsquo;d like. You may refute specific points in his essay (but do not choose more than two specific points); you may offer a more general response to his essay; you may choose to structure your argument like Carr&rsquo;s and offer anecdotal evidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your response is due by 9 am Thursday morning.</p>(*)1465480800|!|c2455b859b5c0b89eeebba7d968d336f(*)The Net (1995)(*)c65708364809cd385b24d3c5bcc8b403(*)1465398022(*)(*)(*)<p>Themes and questions for discussion:</p>
<p>New technologies&mdash;what kinds of 1990s technology do we see and what is it used for? Consider how computers have become integrated into everyday life.</p>

<p>The recurring theme of memory/forgetting&mdash;where do you see this and what does it mean?</p>

You have an attachment to your BOE-Bot that you will need to program in order to hit a marble golf ball around the course. There are two courses (Course A and Course B) with different objectives on each course. Starting position on each course is up to each team.</p>
<p><strong>Course A (12 Marbles)</strong></p>
<p>You will be given five minutes on this course during which time you will be challenged to score as many points as possible. There will be 12 marbles placed on the field in a predetermined pattern. The pattern will be marked on the field&commasepar; and will be the same for all teams.</p>
<p>One point will be awarded for scoring a marble in the center hole&nbsp;<br />Three points for the hole to the right of center&nbsp;<br />Five points for the hole to the left of center&nbsp;<br />Note: the holes have differing levels of inclination.</p>
<p><strong>Course B (5 Marbles)</strong></p>
<p>This field will only have five marbles placed in a set pattern. You will be given five minutes on this field to score as many points as possible using the same scoring system as the first field. Five bonus points will be awarded on this field for scoring with all of the marbles.</p>
<p>Only the "putter" may be used to move the marble. You are not allowed to push the marble around with the bot itself. The initial starting point for both courses is left up to each team to decide. You can choose any location to begin the challenge.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;putting greens&nbsp;will be available for practice in Bogard Hall 305 during Team Time.

<p><strong>Note: There will be a two and half minute break between rounds.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Queue</strong></p>
<p>The queue will be determined using the results from Boe-Bot Challenge 1. In the order of the results&commasepar; teams will chose which field to start in and what the starting position will be (1 through 4). The four teams will start on their respective course&commasepar; and then move over to the other course competing in the same order.</p>
