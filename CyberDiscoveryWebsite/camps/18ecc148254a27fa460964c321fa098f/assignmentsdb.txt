Each paragraph will have a very specific task&commasepar;&nbsp;which are as follows:</p>
<p>In paragraph one&commasepar; choose a piece of data or information from today's&nbsp;scenario that you felt you or your group could easily&nbsp;dismiss/understand without much thought. Explain why this part of the&nbsp;scenario seemed so easy to grasp&commasepar; ie&commasepar; why you did not have to think&nbsp;much about "meaning" vis-&agrave;-vis this particular piece of information?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was this piece of information/data so "easy" to interpret? Think&nbsp;about what I said today about general concepts and stereotypes.</p>
<p>In paragraph two&commasepar; explain how the same piece of data/information from&nbsp;your first paragraph could possibly be interpreted in a completely&nbsp;different manner. How did a little extra thought change the meaning&nbsp;of the data/information? Did context or some other specific piece of&nbsp;information help? What exception did you find from the&nbsp;generalization/stereotype in paragraph one? Do not feel as if you&nbsp;must answer each of these questions but use them to brainstorm.</p>
<p>In your final paragraph&commasepar; using your previous two examples for support&commasepar;&nbsp;come to a conclusion about perception and interpretation.</p>(*)1529587800|!|39b985ef9a4580b664f1932c66ed63bb(*)Essay 3(*)d259eb37bc4b04d541b63122d52e40e9(*)1529589612(*)(*)(*)<p>Consider <a href="camps/18ecc148254a27fa460964c321fa098f/assignments_uploads/FBI%20File.pdf">this FBI intelligence report</a> of Malcolm Little (AKA Malcolm X) from 1953. What does this document tell you about the FBI&rsquo;s focus and fears in 1953? What type of information has the FBI collected on the target? Do you believe that this information is necessarily useful&commasepar; given the organization&rsquo;s fears? Do you feel that the FBI&rsquo;s judgements about this individual are correct? In other words&commasepar; is this document persuasive? Finally&commasepar; does this document present any evidence of prejudiced thinking? If so&commasepar; how do you think this prejudice influenced the report and investigation?</p>(*)1529674200|!|74f935b86b1f7638e8224572a7072a03(*)Essay 4(*)d259eb37bc4b04d541b63122d52e40e9(*)1529675165(*)d259eb37bc4b04d541b63122d52e40e9(*)1529696107(*)<p>Your final essay assignment is to draw on what you learned today about how incomplete&nbsp;information creates uncertainty and the possibility that otherwise rational actors can make serious&nbsp;mistakes by misperceiving the world around them.</p>
<p>Your task is to look through the provided articles (see below) and analyze the climate of uncertainty surrounding&nbsp;the India-Pakistan dispute over the Kashmir region.&nbsp; You are also welcome to consult additional&nbsp;sources or news articles about this critical and ongoing issue&commasepar; but doing so is not necessary.</p>
<p>Please write a 500-word essay that highlights two to three problems that create uncertainty between&nbsp;India and Pakistan&commasepar; and how both sides might interpret/misperceive the actions of the other.&nbsp; Can&nbsp;these obstacles be overcome?&nbsp; If so&commasepar; what suggestions would you make to the leaders of India and&nbsp;Pakistan to resolve their conflict?</p>
