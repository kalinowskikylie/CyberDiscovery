<br>
Themes and questions to consider:<br>
<br>
1. The Cold War Context - in what way does the Cold War drive the plot of the film? How does the Soviet threat drive the technological innovation on display in the film?<br>
<br>
2. Level of Technology - what does Cyber look like at this time (1983, mind you)? How, for instance, does one get on-line? And what (if anything) does Cyber-Security involve?<br>
<br>
3. Military-Industrial Complex - what role does the military play in the development of Cyber-Space? How does the military draw on different sectors of society (the University, for instance) to achieve its objectives?<br>
<br>
4. Automation and Artificial Intelligence - in the military\'s estimation, how does WOPR represent an improvement over human agents? By the end of the film, how has WOPR changed? Is it more or less like the humans it replaced? <br>
<br>
5. Man vs. Machine -  although this story has a very specific focus (Cold War, Military Technology, etc.), its theme is nevertheless timeless. How does it help us to see the problem man always has with the things he builds? Does technological innovation always equal progress? <br> (*)Last edited by: Heath Tims on May 30, 2011(*)undefined(*)(*)(*)(*)*****END_OF_ENTRY*****Reading Assignment: Wendell Berry<BR><BR>Writing Assignment:<BR>Imagine you read Berry\'s essay when it was first published in 1990, and Harper\'s asked you to write a response that would be published along with his reply. What would you say regarding both his argument in general, as well as his particular examples and issues? Is there a sense in which his \"indictment\" of technological innovation (especially the proliferation of computers) is correct? And if so, can you give any examples in your own life of technology that ends up doing more harm than good? Or, is Berry\'s analysis flawed, which leads him to see solutions as problems? If so, what is wrong in his chain of reasoning that produces this erroneous judgment? And can you think of any technological innovation that meets or exceeds his standards laid out on pg. 32? Be sure in your response to anticipate his reply to your response, for as you have seen, he will be able to use your words, and hence your ideas, against you.<BR><BR>Grading rubric (*)Last edited by: Jeremy Mhire on May 31, 2011(*)undefined(*)Berry.pdf(*)rubric for grading essays.pdf(*)(*)*****END_OF_ENTRY*****<b><font color:blue=\"\">BOE-Bot Challenge 1</font></b>
<br>
<br>
The first BOE-Bot challenge is for your team to program one of your bots to navigate a <a style=\"color:blue;  text-decoration:underline\" href=\"http://cyberdiscovery.latech.edu/assignments/boe-bot%20maze%205_31_11.jpg\">\"Maze\"</a>. Your bot will not be tethered to your computer during this competition; therefore, you will need to pre-program your bot to complete the maze on it\'s own. <br>
<br>
The bot will start at the location marked by the red dot. The objective of this competition is for the bot to follow your program and arrive at the location marked by the red rectangle. A timer will start when your bots begins to move and will stop when part of your bot touches the wall marked with the red rectangle (or becomes immobilized). <br>
<br>
Points will be awarded starting with 100 points to the team that completes the maze in the fastest time down to 10 points to the team that either finishes the maze in the slowest time or is the farthest from the objective when their bot stalls.<br>

<br>
Trivia: The movie deals with the impact of a factoring breakthrough on encryption, an obvious reference to the RSA algorithm, one of the most popular methods of encrypting any form of data in the world. The computer in the room off of Cosmo\'s office in the PlayTronics building (the one that looks like a circular bench) is actually a Cray Y-MP, a multi-million dollar supercomputer that was one of the worlds fastest computers at the time the film was made. James Earl Jones\' character, Bernard Abbott, was named after Robert Abbott, a charismatic technical consultant for the film. Abbott designed the first time-sharing (multi-user) operating system for the Cray CDC-6600, the predecessor of the Y-MP seen in the film. He is also often referred to as the \"Father of Information Security\" by seasoned veterans of the computing industry.<br> 
<br>
Questions for discussion: What’s the purpose of the opening sequence in 1969?<br> 
<br>
What is the role of the NSA (National Security Agency) as explained early in the film?<br> 
<br>
What’s the significance of the Scrabble game in the film?<br> 
<br>
What, exactly, is Dr. Janek’s “black box”?<br> 
<br>
What is Cosmo’s plan for “changing the world” and why does he need the “black box”?<br> 
<br>
Do you agree with Cosmo’s argument at the end of the film that “who controls the information” will determine the balance of power in the future? Why or why not? (*)Last edited by: Brian Etheridge on May 31, 2011(*)undefined(*)(*)(*)(*)*****END_OF_ENTRY*****<b>Cyber Liberties Assignment</b> <br>
<br>
In one of his most famous speeches made to a special session of Congress on July 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln uttered this now immortal remark that encapsulates well the tension between security and liberty:<br>
<br>
It (The Civil War) presents the question, whether discontented individuals, too few in numbers to control administration, according to organic law, in any case, can always, upon the pretenses made in this case, or on any other pretenses, or arbitrarily, without any pretense, break up their Government, and thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth. It forces us to ask: \"Is there, in all republics, this inherent and fatal weakness? Must a Government, of necessity, be too strong for the liberties of its own people, or too weak to maintain its own existence?\"<br>
<br>
Though Lincoln was clearly dealing here with problems specific to the Civil War, the issues he raises are as relevant today as they were then. Is it possible for a government, which has as its first duty the protection of life, to also protect the rights and freedoms of its people? Does the government on occasion have to sacrifice freedom and liberty for security? If so, what is to prevent it from abusing its power? Conversely, are there any rights that the government must hold inviolable, i.e., that under no circumstances may it infringe upon these rights? If so, what are these rights, and what makes them so important? Discuss these issues explicitly in the context of digital technology and Cyber-Security: what are the issues we face when using the Internet, and how can we best address them?

Cyber Discovery students, get ready create your CyberFort! Please read and follow these instructions and gather these downloads:<br><br>


1. A handout and guide for creating your cyberfort<br>
Handout_for_Cyberfort2011.pdf<br><br>


The Cyberfort is worth 100 points in declining order less 10 points. Any models submitted late to Bill Willoughby will not be judged. Your assigned computers should have a computer application called Google SketchUp 7 or 8 free version (http://sketchup.google.com/). In class, we will use this SketchUp file as a basis for the design and modeling of your team\'s CyberFort. Your cyberfort will be due at 6:30PM on Thursday.<br><br>


Delete all extraneous information in your 3-D file . . . All we need is your Cyberfort. Not the arena, not the model of the Boe-bot, not the example forts, and no extra lines or surfaces in your model.<br><br>


IMPORTANT!!! Name your file after your school! If you do not designate the file this way, we will not know which cut-out belongs to which school.<br><br>


Any files date stamped as submitted after this time will not be judged and therefore gain no points for the development of your Cyberfort . . . so be on time! Upon judging, each forts will be ranked in descending order. Willoughby and the architecture research assistants will review your fort by these criteria (listed in no order of priority): overall aesthetics, functionality, seamless interfacing with the Boe-Bot, precision crafting of your final fort, your ability to follow written instructions, how well you kept within the space/site limits, and how close your final cyberfort keeps to your original digital design (the least number of changes).<br><br>


2. A Sketch-Up model of the arena for the Boe-Bot challenge, a basic model of a Boe-Bot, and various examples of Cyberforts for you to consider in developing your own cyberfort design. I would suggest becoming familiar with the arena layout and the examples of the cyberforts.
Campus_two_pentagon_2011.skp<br><br>


3. And last, a chapter from William J. Mitchell\'s book e-topia, called \"Prologue: Urban Requiem.\" Be sure to read it before Thursday\'s 1:45 talk.
Mitchell_e-topia_prologue.pdf<br><br>


William J. Mitchell\'s book e-topia, \"Prologue: Urban Requiem\" for tomorrow: and consider these three questions: What \"died\" and therefore requires a requiem? What features of the \"deceased\" are these three mourners eulogizing? And last, will cities become outmoded as cyberspace expands and evolves? <br><br>


William (Bill) Mitchell is Professor of Architecture and Media Arts and Sciences at MIT and former Dean of the School of Architecture and Planning (MIT). He currently directs the MIT Design Laboratory and is a member of the MIT Media Lab\'s Smart Cities Research Group.(*)Last edited by: Krystal Corbett on June 1, 2011(*)undefined(*)Handout_for_Cyberfort2011.pdf(*)arena_2011_final.skp(*)Mitchell_e-topia_prologue.pdf(*)*****END_OF_ENTRY*****<b>BOE-Bot Challenge #2</b><br>
<br>
The next BOE-Bot challenge is a hybrid of polo and mini-golf. You have an attachment to your BOE-Bot that you will need to program in order to hit a marble golf ball around the course. You will be given five minutes on the first course during which time you will be challenged to score as many points as possible. There will be 12 marbles placed on the field in a predetermined pattern. The pattern will be marked on the field, and will be the same for all teams.<br><br><dd>One point will be awarded for scoring a marble in the center hole<br>Three points for the hole to the right of center<br>Five points for the hole to the left of center</dd><br><br>
After competing on the first field, your team will move to the second field. This field will only have five marbles placed in a set pattern. You will be given five minutes on this field to score as many points as possible using the same scoring system as the first field. Five bonus points will be awarded on this field for scoring with all of the marbles.<br><br>
Only the \"putter\" may be used to move the marble. You are not allowed to push the marble around with the bot itself.<br>
<br>
The putting greens will be available for practice in Bogard Hall 305.<br>
<br>
